# custom-pano-streetview

This file is not meant for distribution or production use. This is a pet project using Google Streetview to add custom pano's that I've taken and am hosting publically on Flickr. You are very welcome to use any part of the code on an as-is basis. Any other image input is currently out of scope (e.g. if you want to use private Flickr photos).

The intent of the code is to start with an existing Streetview and then include custom links that navigate to preexisting pano's.
